Question:

Create a Java program with a parent class Vehicle that has a constructor initializing the speed variable. Then, create a subclass Car that uses the super keyword to call the parent class constructor and display the speed.

Expected Outcome:

When creating a Car object, it should call the Vehicle constructor using super and print the speed value.


class Vehicle{
    Vehicle(int speed){
        System.out.println(speed);
    }

    }

class Car extends Vehicle {
    Car(int speed) {
        super(speed);

    }

}
public class prac {
    public static void main(String [] args){
        Car c=new Car(600);

}

}
